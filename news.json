        "description": "There's growing interest in the benefits of a four-day workweek for productivity and employee wellbeing, but the picture is more complicated when it comes to climate change.",
        "text": "In 2011, Simon Ursell and the three other co-founders of newly born environmental consultancy Tyler Grange based in Gloucestershire, UK, decided to give all their workers a day off a month to volunteer.\nThey had found that many of their new employees already spent their free time volunteering in wildlife trusts. 'Our ecologists have always loved being ecologists,' Ursell says.\nBut last year, Tyler Grange took what some would see as a far more radical step towards workers wellbeing by trying out giving all employees a fifth of their workweek off.\nThe company joined the world's biggest ever four-day workweek trial, which took place in the UK from June to December 2022. The pilot aimed to assess whether companies could maintain productivity with a reduced working time – and, importantly, with no loss in pay for employees.\nManagers and workers at Tyler Grange celebrated the breakthrough with enthusiasm, with their results showing daily productivity rose by 22%. But Ursell was also keen to measure another outcome: the impact of the shorter workweek on the company's carbon footprint. And the four-day workweek turned out to be surprisingly good for this too, he says.\n'On average we saw a 21% reduction in the number of miles travelled by car,' he notes with a cheerful smile. Tyler Grange cut out meetings and travel that were unnecessary. Many employees used their additional days off to become even more involved in climate volunteering.\nThe conversation around the four-day workweek is gaining momentum all over the world. The non-profit which coordinated the UK trial, 4 Day Week Global, had already carried out pilots in the US and Ireland, while the public sector in Iceland and companies in Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Japan and New Zealand have all tested the impact of a shorter workweek.\nBut the UK trial was the biggest yet, involving more than 60 firms and organisations. The final results were published on 21 February, and some of the companies are making bolder claims supporting what previous studies suggested: a shorter workweek could help the planet.\nJuliet Schor, an economist and sociologist at Boston College and lead researcher at 4 Day Week Global who worked on both the UK and US pilots, argues that a shorter working week is key to achieving the carbon emissions reductions the world needs.\n'Although climate benefits are the most challenging thing to measure, we have a lot of research showing that over time, as countries reduce hours of work, their carbon emissions fall,' she says. A 10% reduction in hours is associated to an 8.6% fall in carbon footprint, according to a study co-authored by Schor in 2012. ",

Over 33,000 fans from 170 countries have taken part in them.\nThe most successful of these has been 'No K-pop on a dead planet'. It called for K-pop albums to go green by selling digital rather than physical albums, minimising the packaging and encouraging low carbon performances.\nThe culture of buying physical albums is strong for many K-pop fans. It’s a way of showing support for their favourite band and there’s excitement in finding a photocard of your 'bias' (a K-pop fan term for your favourite member of a band) stashed inside. It’s a culture that can lead to overconsumption as fans buy multiple copies of one album to boost their favourite band and collect as many photocards as they can.\nCarla believes that their lobbying is having an impact on the industry. She points to the example of the band Victon. For the release of their album Chronograph, they gave fans a choice between buying the usual physical album or opting instead to be sent just the photocard and receive a digital copy of the album.\nThe 'No K-pop on a dead planet' campaign also led to discussions between Kpop4planet, the Korean government and the entertainment industry about implementing more sustainable practices.\n'A couple of them like SM Entertainment have joined the UN Global Compact and there's also JYP, they are joining the Korean Renewable 100 [a global initiative where businesses commit to running their operations 100 per cent from renewable energies]. They are the first K-pop company to join this one,' Nurul says.\n'This shows that now companies, even the government, are listening to the fans' voices, not only because they are the consumers, but also because we really care about these industries.'",

In 2021, it extended this to weekdays for under-18s and over-65s.\nThe further extension of the scheme is part of the city’s €150 million push for zero carbon mobility, which also includes investment in cycle lanes and the creation of a low emissions zone.\nMontpellier is far from being a trailblazer. In fact, French towns and cities have been rolling out such schemes since the country’s transport management was decentralised in 2015.\nHowever the majority of these have less than 150,000 inhabitants.\nWith almost 200,000 inhabitants, Dunkirk is the largest city to have embraced free transport so far. After it introduced fare-free bus routes in 2018, passenger numbers increased by an average of 85 per cent.\nThe scheme is funded by a small increase in the Mobility Payment tax already levied on public and private companies in France with more than 10 employees.\nIn total, 39 territories in France have similar schemes, including the Marseille suburb of Aubagne, the port city of Calais and the western commune of Niort.\nMontpellier will be the largest city so far to adopt such a scheme.",

Not only that, it can do so using a relatively small blood sample, according to senior researcher Dr. Muhammed Murtaza, of the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health, in Madison.\nThat's relative to other blood tests under development for cancer screening, which typically require multiple tubes of blood.\n'The biggest advantage of our approach would probably be in cost-effectiveness,' Murtaza said, although he added that it's hard to make predictions on real-world costs.\nThe study, published Jan. 11 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, is among the latest in the broader push to develop blood tests that can serve as a one-stop screening for multiple cancers.\nA number of companies are working on such 'multi-cancer' early detection tests. Essentially, they are all based on the fact that tumors shed bits of genetic material in the blood. If a test can detect those tumor signals, that could provide a simple, noninvasive way to screen for various cancers—including ones that now lack any screening method.",

        "text": "Child Trends’ report, Lessons From a Historic Decline in Child Poverty, tells an important story about the historic 59 percent decline in child poverty seen in the United States over the last quarter century. Child Trends’ report examined the various economic, demographic, and policy factors that led to the decline in poverty among children from birth to age 18.However, poverty is likely to be particularly harmful to our youngest children, who need access to certain resources during critical stages of early child development.\nIn 2021, 18 percent of children from birth to age 5 in the United States lived in families with incomes below the federal poverty level. Young children develop at an accelerated rate, learning and growing faster than at any other period in their lives. To fuel that growth, they need stable and loving families and caregivers; positive learning experiences; and access to food, shelter, and high-quality physical and mental health resources. These cornerstones of development are compromised for children living in poverty. Families in poverty may experience chronic stress, limited access to learning experiences and health services, and challenges to securing nutritional food and safe housing. These factors can have long-term impacts on the healthy development of young children, which have cascading and cumulative effects on their ongoing development. The earlier a child’s exposure to poverty, the greater the developmental consequences.\nApproaches to mitigating poverty for young children should also consider that young children of color—all racial and ethnic groups who are not White, and who constitute just over half of U.S. infants and toddlers in 2022—disproportionately experience poverty due to historical and structural inequities. Due to this history of racism, many of these families face systemic obstacles in connecting to employment opportunities and gaining generational wealth; many are not offered the same opportunities or pay for employment, or encounter discrimination and legal barriers that block their access to homeownership and housing stability. The rates of poverty for Native American, Black, and Hispanic infants and toddlers are all higher than the national average, with Native American and Black infant and toddler poverty rates approximately twice as high. These disparities and the historical context and systemic conditions that drive them must be addressed to lift all young children out of poverty.\nIn this brief, we complement the Child Trends report with a few thoughts on the needs of the youngest children living in poverty, and on how policymakers, practitioners, and researchers can consider these needs in designing and implementing anti-poverty efforts.",

But the hormone has many other functions, such as the regulation of lactation and uterine contractions in females, and the regulation of ejaculation, sperm transport, and testosterone production in males.\nNow, researchers from Michigan State University show that in zebrafish and human cell cultures, oxytocin has yet another unsuspected function: It stimulates stem cells derived from the heart's outer layer (epicardium) to migrate into its middle layer (myocardium) and there develop into cardiomyocytes, muscle cells that generate heart contractions. This discovery could one day be used to promote the regeneration of the human heart after a heart attack. The results are published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology.\n'Here we show that oxytocin, a neuropeptide also known as the love hormone, is capable of activating heart repair mechanisms in injured hearts in zebrafish and human cell cultures, opening the door to potential new therapies for heart regeneration in humans,' said Dr. Aitor Aguirre, an assistant professor at the Department of Biomedical Engineering of Michigan State University, and the study's senior author.\nCardiomyocytes typically die off in great numbers after a heart attack. Because they are highly specialized cells, they can't replenish themselves. But previous studies have shown that a subset of cells in the epicardium can undergo reprogramming to become stem-like cells, called Epicardium-derived Progenitor Cells (EpiPCs), which can regenerate not only cardiomyocytes, but also other types of heart cells.",

Kissing not only creates a moment of intimate connection but also offers surprising health benefits. So, pucker up and discover how locking lips can boost your overall well-being.\nCan kissing really make us healthy?\nResearch suggests that kissing can indeed contribute to overall health and well-being. A study published in Psychoneuroendocrinology indicated that kissing stimulates the release of certain hormones and neurotransmitters associated with stress reduction and mood improvement.\nAnother study published in Archives of Sexual Behavior revealed that frequent kissing is associated with a decrease in perceived stress levels. The researchers found that those who engaged in regular kissing reported lower levels of stress and higher overall relationship satisfaction.When we kiss, what happens to our hormones?\nWhen we engage in a passionate kiss, our hormonal system ignites into a flurry of activity. The release of hormones plays a crucial role in shaping the physiological and emotional responses associated with this intimate act.\nOne of the main players is oxytocin, often referred to as the 'love hormone.' When we kiss, oxytocin floods our system, promoting feelings of attachment, trust, and intimacy strengthening the emotional bond between partners.\nThen there's dopamine, the pleasure powerhouse. Kissing causes dopamine to be released, resulting in a rush of happy sensations. The surge of dopamine leads to heightened sensations of pleasure, akin to the euphoria experienced when achieving a desired outcome.\nAnd lastly, there's serotonin, which is the mood regulator. Kissing stimulates the release of serotonin, which helps keep those stress levels in check and contributes to a sense of overall well-being. It's like a natural mood booster.\nTogether, the interplay of these hormones during kissing creates a complex biochemical symphony, enhancing the emotional connection and pleasure experienced by people engaging in this intimate act.",

        "text": "Regular physical exercise, such as resistance training, can prevent Alzheimer's disease, or at least delay the appearance of symptoms, and serves as a simple and affordable therapy for Alzheimer's patients. This is the conclusion of an article published in Frontiers in Neuroscience by Brazilian researchers affiliated with the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) and the University of São Paulo (USP).\nAlthough older people and dementia patients are unlikely to be able to do long daily runs or perform other high-intensity aerobic exercises, these activities are the focus for most scientific studies on Alzheimer's. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends resistance exercise as the best option to train balance, improve posture and prevent falls. Resistance exercise entails contraction of specific muscles against an external resistance and is considered an essential strategy to increase muscle mass, strength and bone density, and to improve overall body composition, functional capacity and balance. It also helps prevent or mitigate sarcopenia (muscle atrophy), making everyday tasks easier to perform.\nTo observe the neuroprotective effects of this practice, researchers in UNIFESP's Departments of Physiology and Psychobiology, and the Department of Biochemistry at USP's Institute of Chemistry (IQ-USP), conducted experiments involving transgenic mice with a mutation responsible for a buildup of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. The protein accumulates in the central nervous system, impairs synaptic connections and damages neurons, all of which are features of Alzheimer's disease.\nDuring the study, the mice were trained to climb a 110 cm ladder with a slope of 80° and 2 cm between rungs. Loads corresponding to 75%, 90% and 100% of their body weight were attached to their tails. The experiment mimicked certain kinds of resistance training undertaken by humans in fitness centers.\nAt the end of a four-week period of training, blood samples were taken to measure plasma levels of corticosterone, the hormone in mice equivalent to cortisol in humans; rising levels in response to stress heighten the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Levels of the hormone were normal (equal to those found in the control group comprising animals without the mutation) in the exercise-trained mice, and analysis of their brain tissue showed a decrease in formation of beta-amyloid plaques.\n'This confirms that physical activity can reverse neuropathological alterations that cause clinical symptoms of the disease,' said Henrique Correia Campos, first author of the article.",

State legislators and Gov. Gavin Newsom must agree for any money to be paid or for any policy changes to be adopted.\n'This book of truth will be a legacy, will be a testament to the full story,' said Lisa Holder, a civil rights attorney and task force member. 'Anyone who says that we are colorblind, that we have solved the problem of anti-Black animus and racism, I challenge you to read this document.'\nThe mood was buoyant, but tinged with frustration and anger that hours earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in higher education, programs that have disproportionately helped Black students. Task force members said their suggestions will pass legal muster because the proposed benefits would only go to descendants of enslaved people, not to all Black residents.\nThe panel narrowly voted to limit any financial redress to residents who can document lineage from Black people who were in the U.S. in the 19th century.\nThe 1,100-page report details California’s role in perpetuating discrimination against Black residents. Ideas for repairing the harm range from formally apologizing to paying descendants of enslaved people for having suffered under racist actions such as over-policing and housing discrimination. The panel also recommended creating a new agency to oversee reparations efforts.\nTurning the proposals into policies won’t be easy. State Sen. Steven Bradford said there are 'a lot of folks' in the Legislature who do not support reparations and a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that only 30% of U.S. adults favored the concept.\nA more recent survey by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found 54% of respondents had a negative opinion of California creating a reparations task force, although 59% said they would support a formal apology from the state to descendants.",

        "text": "With a full-time job and a family, Safija Vucenovic, now 67, from the central Bosnian city of Zenica, could rarely find time to commit to music and sewing – her two great passions – when she was younger.\nIt was only when she was pensioned and her children grew up that she started singing in a local female choir, performing solo at music events and designing her own dresses for them.\nBut her newfound pleasure was shaken this spring by the arrival of COVID-19, tying her to her home without social contacts or performances.\nTo banish the feeling of uncertainty and anxiety that overwhelmed many of her peers, she began recording herself with a smartphone while singing her favourite 'sevdalinke' songs and making clothes, sharing the videos with her friends via Facebook and Viber.\n'It helped me, and the others, to keep our spirits up,' Vucenovic recalls.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has hit Bosnia’s senior citizens hard. Between March 20 and May 15 authorities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the larger of the country’s two entities, severely limited freedom of movement of people older than 65 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nEven though it is not mandatory to stay inside any more, many older people still spend most of their time at home, especially since the number of COVID-19 cases began rising in early July.\nPeople aged 65 years and older make up about 14 per cent of Bosnia’s population, according to the 2013 census, and their share in the overall population is increasing.\nThe UN estimates that this age group will represent more than 30 per cent of the population of Bosnia by 2060. Many seniors live on the edge of poverty and are socially excluded. Average pensions of around 200 euros a month often cannot cover even basic expenses.\nSeveral reports, including those published by Caritas BiH and the Institution of the Human Rights Ombudsman of BiH, have noted that the lack of activities in which elderly people can take part makes them isolated and prone to mental illnesses, particularly depression.\nEver since the beginning of the pandemic, media have reported that the elderly are the most at-risk group from COVID-19, although the evidence shows that the disease can be deadly to anyone.\nAt the same time, regular health care services, slow and inadequate even under normal conditions, have now become almost inaccessible to many seniors now because of the special COVID-19-related working regime.\nState hospitals and clinics throughout the country are in debt, often working without basic medical materials and equipment. As health care workers increasingly protest, demanding better salaries and working conditions, more patients complain too.\nIn the last few years, many doctors and nurses have left the country for better jobs in the Western Europe, further weakening Bosnia’s already damaged health care system.\nFor Safija and other members of the Zenica-based Nas most (Our Bridge) association, the only way to keep up with their peers, rather than depressing news, was to turn to technology.\nFrom their own homes, they have been engaging in collective creative work and socializing – the same as they had been doing during the gatherings held in Our Bridge’s art centre before the pandemic – but this time over the Internet.",

Five other species of wild cats, leopard cat, clouded leopard, marbled cat, golden cat and jungle cat, were also found in the park.\nRavaged by insurgents and rampant poaching for nearly two decades, Assam’s Manas National Park had no tigers twenty years ago. But it now boasts 48 members of the endangered species.\nResults of the 12th annual camera trapping survey this year, which covered 876 sq km of the park and adjoining areas with cameras placed at 285 locations, revealed the presence of 48 tigers, of which 38 are adults, 3 sub-adults and 7 cubs.\nThe three-fold rise in the number of adult tigers from 10 in 2010 to 38 in 2021 is a record in tiger conservation in the country. In 2020, 30 adult tigers were recorded in the park.\nLast year, Pilibhit tiger reserve in Uttar Pradesh had bagged an international award, TX2, for more than doubling the number of tigers in four years from 25 in 2014 to 65 in 2018.\n'The findings have brought cheer to everyone in Manas and shows that the efforts at tiger conservation have borne fruit. We have already surpassed the World Wildlife Foundation and Global Tiger Forum’s goal of doubling tiger numbers by 2022,' said Amal Chandra Sarmah, field director, Manas Tiger Project.",

        "text": "Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah has won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature for his 'uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.'\nBorn in 1948, the writer grew up in Zanzibar. After the island liberated itself from the British Empire in 1963, a violent uprising led to widespread persecution of Arab-descended minorities. As a member of a targeted ethnic group, 18-year-old Gurnah was forced to seek refuge in England, writes Alison Flood for the Guardian.\nWhile in exile abroad, Gurnah wrote to cope with the trauma of dislocation.\n'The thing that motivated the whole experience of writing for me was this idea of losing your place in the world,' he tells the New York Times’ Alexandra Alter and Alex Marshall.\nThough Swahili is Gurnah’s first language, 'English became his literary tool,' notes the Swedish Academy, which awards the annual prize, in a statement. Since 1987, he has published ten novels and numerous short stories, many of which follow the lives of refugees as they reckon with loss, displacement and the lasting trauma caused by European colonization of the African continent. A professor emeritus of English and postcolonial studies at the University of Kent, Gurnah has also published literary criticism on Indian-British novelist Salman Rushdie and Kenyan novelist and academic Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, among others.\nGurnah’s debut novel, Memory of Departure, relates the travails of a young man on the East African coast who comes of age under the oppressive conditions of a totalitarian regime. In Paradise, which was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker Prize and is described in the statement as his 'breakthrough' work, Gurnah writes from the perspective of Yusuf, a 12-year-old boy who is forced into indentured servitude in East Africa in the years leading up to World War I.",

        "text": "By deliberately infecting people with the flu and cold viruses, researchers have strengthened the evidence that wearable health monitors could help stem the spread of infectious diseases.\nCatching viruses early: It takes about two days after a person is exposed to the flu virus for symptoms to develop. For the viruses that cause the common cold, the incubation period can be one to three days.\nDuring this period that a person is infected but feels fine, they might go to work, school, or other places where they spread the virus to others, so it’d be useful to be able to detect infections before the onset of symptoms — and wearable health monitors might make that possible.\nThe idea: By looking at the biometric data collected by Fitbits, smart watches, and other wearables, we might be able to see changes that indicate a person is infected before they start to feel sick.\nThis early warning could not only let people know they should avoid situations where they might spread an infection to others, but also give them the opportunity to be treated sooner, when interventions are most effective.\nThe challenge: Figuring out whether health monitors could work as early infection detectors has proven difficult, though, as past studies have all relied on people catching viruses 'in the wild.'\n That meant researchers never knew when a person was actually exposed to a bug — and without a starting point to work from, it was impossible to know how long it took a wearable to pick up on an infection.\nThis approach also put a severe limit on sample sizes in the studies — one group enrolled more than 30,000 people in a study to see whether health monitors could detect COVID-19, but only 54 people ended up testing positive for the disease during the course of the study.",

        "text": "'Ladies and gentlemen, rock 'n' roll.'\nThose were the words spoken by Warner Cable executive John Lack on Aug. 1, 1981, at 12:01 am when MTV — Music Television — went on air for the very first time. It was accompanied by the image of an astronaut, modeled after Neil Armstrong, and an MTV flag planted on the moon's surface. Comparing the station to the moon landing may have come off as hubristic at the time, but MTV would go on to change pop music and its impact on popular culture forever.\nThe very first music video shown on MTV was The Buggles' 'Video Killed The Radio Star.' While the channel's distribution was hard to come by, the rallying cry of 'I want my MTV' became a mantra for consumers.\nMany of the first videos the station aired became hits; a new generation of music fans became acquainted with the freshman class of VJs or video jockeys, including Martha Quinn, Nina Blackwood, Alan Hunter, J.J. Jackson and Mark Goodman. Together, they would go on to present some of the coolest, weirdest, cheesiest and worst music videos of the 1980s and beyond.\nIn their book I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution, music journalists and co-authors Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum note that at the channel's outset, not many people in the industry thought it would succeed. They were wrong.\nThe golden age of MTV — between its inception in 1981 and 1992 — blossomed globally. Videos became important cultural objects. Specialty shows like Yo! MTV Raps, Headbangers Ball, MTV Unplugged, 120 Minutes and even goofy game shows like Remote Control launched dozens of musicians' careers and became TV you didn't want to miss.",

        "text": "Plastics have become an unavoidable part of our lives. Try as you might, you can’t get away from it fully. According to reports, humans around the globe buy a million plastic bottles per minute, and 91% of all plastic is not recycled.\nIndia’s annual plastic consumption is expected to cross 20 million tonnes in 2020. The main issue with plastics is they break down into microscopic particles and seep into our soil and water bodies. Imagine that the plastic straw you used for a few minutes to sip a drink will lie on this planet for a thousand years!\nEraviperoor Panchayat in Kerala, for instance, has implemented a plastic recycling project which makes use of non-recyclable plastic for laying roads.\nThe Better India caught up with Renjith Abraham, who is associated with Suchitwa Mission, a local self-government department of the Kerala government, ensuring that non-recyclable plastic is put to good use.\nIn 2012, Rajagiri College, Ernakulam, had experimented with polymerised roads by using waste plastics for blacktopping 500 metres of campus road.\nThis news soon spread and inspired the former president of the Grama Panchayat who was looking for ways to manage plastic waste. The Panchayat Council approached the Public Works Department (PWD) for technicalities. When their idea was approved, they started using shredded plastics along with bitumen for tarring roads, says Renjith.\nKudumbashree is a self-help initiative by the Kerala movement. Its workers go from door-to-door every fortnight to collect non-recyclable plastic.\nVarious awareness drives are also organised to sensitise the locals and ensure participation from everyone.\nAnything that cannot be recycled constitutes non-recyclable products. Examples are food storage containers, styrofoam, disposable diapers, bottle caps, and even PVC pipes.\nA plastic shredding machine that can shred 500 kg of plastics a day was installed where all the collected plastic is deposited. The shredded plastic is sold by the panchayat to the PWD, which then uses it in its road construction. So far, the panchayat has sold 800 kg of plastic to PWD at Rs 20 per kg.",

The youth put aside their political differences to send their governments an important message: 'We must put the unfortunate hatred aside and focus on what actually matters the most: saving the world from an ongoing climate breakdown' as Michael Bäcklund a 16-year-old protester and the global outreach director of strike4future-Israel wrote in an editorial in Climate Home News.\n'We had Arab Palestinians and Jewish Israelis participating together. We have multiplied our following on social media and we have started to plan a social media campaign with celebrities. We have also been asked to do a bunch of television and newspaper interviews' Bäcklund wrote.\nBäcklund emphasized that although the movement for climate change has been going strong since December 2018, they are still struggling to convince the majority of the Israeli people to put aside their political problems and focus on saving their country and the world from impending climate breakdown.\n'In Israel we face extreme weather conditions, mainly drought. Agriculture will suffer. The lack of water will increase when the temperature rises and heat waves arrive,' Bäcklund wrote. 'Low income families will struggle with prices, spending will decrease, real estate business will become harder, hyper-inflation will arrive, not only in our country, but across the Middle East.'",

        "text": "On a warm afternoon, two 16-year-old boys from North Philadelphia signed a contract. By etching their names onto a piece of paper, they made a promise to call a truce.\nIn the months leading up to this moment, the teens had been dueling. Messages darted back and forth between their phones, their social media inboxes crowded with threats. Eventually, the two encountered each other at a nearby Six Flags. There, one boy raised a hostile warning: Next time, he would bring a gun.\nWhen Alisha Corley, one of the boys' mothers, learned about the confrontation, she panicked. It had only been 16 years since she tragically lost her 5-year-old daughter to the bullet of a firearm.\nFor families like Corley’s in North Philly, gun violence is an everyday part of life. In a sense, the city serves as a microcosm of a larger-scale public health crisis. As of September, 14,516 people in the U.S. have lost their lives to guns this year, putting 2021 on track to be the deadliest in decades. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, young Black men and teens are 20 times more likely than their white counterparts to die by firearm.\nDesperate to keep her son from becoming a statistic, Corley searched for a way to protect him. She landed on Philly Truce, an app for iOS and Android that allows Philadelphians in crisis to press a 'get help' button. By doing so, users are connected to trained mediators who provide an array of services, including empathic listening, referral to wraparound services (such as mental health care), and conflict intervention. The app offers a trauma-informed alternative to contacting the police, which can in some cases intensify violence.\nBy connecting with the program, Corley gained access to free mediation services that ultimately allowed her son to come calmly face-to-face with the other boy. After hearing each other out, the teens realized they were more alike than different. Threats of intimidation and violence quickly gave way to open dialogue and understanding. By the end of the meeting, they agreed on a contract of peace: a Philly Truce.\nThe masterminds behind this exchange are Steven Pickens and Mazzie Casher, natives of North Philly, friends, and cofounders of the Philly Truce app. Pickens, a first responder for the local fire department, and Casher, a hip-hop artist, met in high school three decades ago. Today, the two men are in their 40s and have become central pillars of their local Black community.\n'In parts of Philadelphia, people are prisoners in their own homes,' Pickens explains. 'People have to be careful in certain neighborhoods just to sit on their own front steps.'\nFor most of their lives, Casher and Pickens felt like gun violence was an inevitability. 'We became hopeless. We became numb, and we kind of accepted the narrative that this is the way it is in the city. This is the way it is between Black and Brown people, between poor people and the police,' Casher says. Like many folks that have experienced the reverberations of complex trauma, numbness felt like the only coping mechanism within reach.",

It will connect to several European countries.\nThe move came as the European Union unveiled plans to transform its electricity system to rely mostly on renewable energy within a decade and increase its offshore wind energy capacity 25-fold by 2050.\n'This is truly a great moment for Denmark and for the global green transition,' Danish Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen told a press briefing on Thursday.\nThe energy hub in the North Sea will be the largest construction project in Danish history.\n'[The island] will make a big contribution to the realisation of the enormous potential for European offshore wind,' he said.\nThe energy island, which will cost around 210 billion Danish kroner ($33.9bn) to build, is an important part of Denmark’s legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels, one of the world’s most ambitious.",

For example, languages generally replace certain sounds when evolving from their predecessors, though they rarely create or remove an entire sound.\nThis predictability allows the algorithm to model to segment words from an ancient language and map them to a related language. In doing this, the system can also identify language families.\nFor example, when trained on Basque, the regional language used in Spain's Basque Country, the algorithm said that the language is not related to Basque, supporting recent scholarship on the topic suggesting that the two languages are not closely related despite the Basque Country being located on the Iberian peninsula.",
